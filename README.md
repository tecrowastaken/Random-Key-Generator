# Random Key Generator
Originally written in rust but moved now to C for better simplicity
is a Commandline Tool designed for generating large encryption 
keys and passwords and can be utilized for different tools such 
as veracrypt and cryptomater and many more, this can also can be 
an alternative method to using a password manager as the keys that
can be generated can be exteremely difficult to crack unless an attacker 
is able to find your key.
